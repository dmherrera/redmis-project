### Objective
In this project we will be building a page for registration to the REDMIS association.<br>
Some of the key points are:
- It should include a landing page(?)
- It should have a registration page with upload documentation available
- It should show some available subscription options to the page:
  - Bronce
  - Silver
  - Gold
- It should have 3 different type of users:
  - Registree
  - Registration Admin
  - Evaluator

### Process
A person will apply to one of the subscription options, then the Registration admin will check that the application has all information needed and assign evaluators who will determine if the registree will have access to the site.
